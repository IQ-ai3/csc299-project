# Project Plan for Task Manager

## Purpose
The Task Manager is a simple command-line interface application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to add new tasks and list existing tasks, providing a straightforward way to keep track of what needs to be done.

## Features
- Add new tasks with a title and description.
- List all existing tasks with their details.
- Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`tasks.json`) for persistence.
- Each task has a unique ID for easy identification.

## Architecture
The project is structured into several modules, each with a specific responsibility:

1. **src/main.py**: 
   - Entry point of the application.
   - Initializes the command-line interface and handles user input.

2. **src/cli.py**: 
   - Contains the logic for the command-line interface.
   - Defines functions for parsing command-line arguments and invoking actions (adding or listing tasks).

3. **src/task_manager.py**: 
   - Exports the `TaskManager` class.
   - Manages tasks, including methods to add a task, list all tasks, and load/save tasks from/to `tasks.json`.

4. **src/utils.py**: 
   - Contains utility functions for reading from and writing to `tasks.json`.
   - Includes functions for generating unique IDs for tasks.

5. **tasks.json**: 
   - Stores tasks in JSON format.
   - Each task is represented as an object with an ID, title, and description.

## Dependencies
The project may require the following libraries:
- `json` for handling JSON data.
- `argparse` for parsing command-line arguments.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement task editing and deletion features.
- Add due dates and priority levels for tasks.
- Introduce a user authentication system for personal task management.
